    "text": "Welcome to the Ready for R! Workshop Series organised by the Research Training Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Malaya, Malaysia\n\n\nThis workshop lays the groundwork for addressing key practical aspects of programming and other essential computer skills needed for both research and implementation of statistical methods in three parts. In its first section, the workshop will introduce participants to programming in R and the tidyverse, guidance on coding best practices, and a primer on data wrangling. The second section will explore data visualization, as well as an exploration of both descriptive and inferential statistics using R. The final section of the workshop introduces the concept of regression analysis in R.\n\n\n\nHave a look at the schedule below and download the necessary .qmd files for each session. While I have included solutions- it would be way more beneficial to attempt these yourself first. Lets try to maximise learning in the three sessions.\nIf you are new to R, don’t worry - start off with this deck to learn how to install the software and familiarise yourself with the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nTime\nTopic\n\n\n\n\n18.8.2023 (Friday)\n8.00 am - 8.30 am\nIntroduction to R\n\n\n\n8.30 am - 9.30 am\nTaking the Wheel #1\n\n\n\n9.30 am - 10.00 am\nBreak\n\n\n\n10.00 am - 10.45 am\nBasics of Tidyverse\n\n\n\n10.45 am - 12.15 pm\nTaking the Wheel #2\n\n\n\n12.15 pm - 12.30 pm\nQ&A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nTime\nTopic\n\n\n\n\n29.08.2023 (Tuesday)\n8.00 am - 8.30 am\nDescriptive Statistics in R\n\n\n\n8.30 am - 9.30 am\nTaking the Wheel #1\n\n\n\n9.30 am - 10.00 am\nBreak\n\n\n\n10.00 am - 10.45 am\nBasics of ggplot2\n\n\n\n10.45 am - 12.15 pm\nTaking the Wheel #2\n\n\n\n12.15 pm - 1.00p pm\nQ&A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate | Time | Topic ||:—————-|:—————-|:————————————-|\n14.09.2023 (Thursday) | 8.00 am - 8.30 am | Inferential Statistics in R |\n                      | 8.30 am - 9.30 am | Taking the Wheel #1 |\n                      | 9.30 am - 10.00 am | Break |\n                      | 10.00 am - 10.45 am | Introduction to Regression Analysis |\n                      | 10.45 am - 12.15 pm | Taking the Wheel #2 |\n                      | 12.15 pm - 1.00 pm | Q&A |\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVivek Jason\nJason is a gazetting Public Health Physician passionate about epidemiology, infectious diseases and data science.
