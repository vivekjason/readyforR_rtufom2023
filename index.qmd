# **Ready for R! Workshop Series**

Welcome to the Ready for R! Workshop Series organised by the Research Training Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Malaya, Malaysia

## **What is this workshop?**

This workshop lays the groundwork for addressing key practical aspects of programming and other essential computer skills needed for both research and implementation of statistical methods in three parts. In its first section, the workshop will introduce participants to programming in R and the tidyverse, guidance on coding best practices, and a primer on data wrangling. The second section will explore data visualization, as well as an exploration of both descriptive and inferential statistics using R. The final section of the workshop introduces the concept of regression analysis in R.

## **Getting started**

Have a look at the schedule below and download the necessary .qmd files for each session. While I have included solutions- it would be way more beneficial to attempt these yourself first. Lets try to maximise learning in the three sessions.

If you are new to R, don't worry - start off with this [deck](http://vivekjason.com/StatsComputingR_sbdr2023/installation.html#/title-slide) to learn how to install the software and familiarise yourself with the environment.
