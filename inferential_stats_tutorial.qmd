### COVID-19 Vaccinations and Death in Malaysia

Call the data in and load packages

```{r, include=FALSE}
#load packages
required_packages <- c("tidyverse", "lubridate", "gtsummary", "rstatix", "janitor", "corrr")
not_installed <- required_packages[!(required_packages %in% installed.packages()[ , "Package"])]    
if(length(not_installed)) install.packages(not_installed)                                           
suppressWarnings(lapply(required_packages, require, character.only = TRUE))

#load data
c19_df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoH-Malaysia/covid19-public/main/epidemic/linelist/linelist_deaths.csv")
```

### **Task 1: Inferential statistics using `rstatix`**

Question: Test if there is a significant difference in age between males and females using the t-test.

Steps:

1.  Install and load the `rstatix` package.

2.  Filter the dataset to remove missing values in the "age" and "male" columns.

3.  Recode the "male" variable to factor.

4.  Conduct a t-test to compare the means.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Step 1
#install.packages("rstatix")
library(rstatix)

# Step 2
c19_df <- c19_df %>% filter(!is.na(age), !is.na(male))

# Step 3
c19_df$male <- factor(c19_df$male, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("Female", "Male"))

# Step 4
c19_df %>% t_test(age ~ male)
```

### **Task 2: Inferential statistics using `gtsummary`**

Question: Test if there is a significant difference in age between Malaysians and non-Malaysians using the t-test, and present the results in a table using gtsummary.

Steps:

1.  Recode the "malaysian" variable to factor (Tip: Use the factor function).

2.  Use the `tbl_summary()` function to present the results.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Step 1
c19_df$malaysian <- factor(c19_df$malaysian, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("Non-Malaysian", "Malaysian"))

# Step 2
t_test_result <- c19_df %>% 
  select(age, malaysian) %>%                 # keep variables of interest
  tbl_summary(                               # produce summary table
    statistic = age ~ "{mean} ({sd})",       # specify what statistics to show
    by = malaysian) %>%                      # specify the grouping variable
  add_p(age ~ "t.test") 
t_test_result
```

### **Task 3: Correlations using `corrr`**

Question: Compute the correlation between age, male, bid, and malaysian variables, and represent it in a correlation plot (Note: The selection of categorical variables is by design- just to practice the selection and presentation)

Steps:

1.  Install and load the `corrr` package.

2.  Create a subset of the data with the selected variables.

3.  Compute the correlation matrix (Note: Try ?network_plot and see how this can be used)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Step 1
#install.packages("corrr")
library(corrr)

# Step 2
df_subset <- c19_df %>% select(age, male, bid, malaysian)

# Step 3
correlation_matrix <- df_subset %>% correlate()

# Step 4
correlation_matrix %>% network_plot()

```

![](/images/network_plot-1.png){fig-align="center"}

This would be the outcome if anything was highly correlated in our data.
